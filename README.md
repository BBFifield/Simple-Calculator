# Simple-Calculator
Just a simple calculator program that can output its calculations by USB serial to an external LCD screen:

- Common multiplication, division, subtraction and addition.
- Square-root and powers.
- Sign switching.

Nothing major and just for fun, but any contributions or suggestions are welcome.
